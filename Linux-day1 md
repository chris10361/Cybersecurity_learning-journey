# Linux Learning Journey - Day 1

**Date:** 7 August 2025

## What I Learned Today
Today, I explored important system directories in Linux and practiced navigating the filesystem using basic commands.

### Commands Practiced:
- `pwd` → Print current working directory
- `cd` → Change directory
- `ls` → List files and directories

### Directories Explored:
- **/dev** → Contains device files (interfaces to hardware and virtual devices)
- **/bin** → Holds essential user command binaries (e.g., ls, cat, cp)
- **/etc/network** → Network configuration files
- **/var/log** → Stores log files for troubleshooting
- **/etc** → Configuration files for the system

### Why This Matters:
Understanding these directories is essential for:
- Troubleshooting
- Security analysis
- System administration tasks
